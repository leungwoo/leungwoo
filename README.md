   Greetings, everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Richard.

ðŸ”­ As a dedicated developer, I thrive on remote work, where I tackle exciting projects. My expertise lies in React and NextJS, and I'm always eager to embrace new front-end technologies like Angular and WordPress.

ðŸŒ± Beyond that, my curiosity extends to cloud computing. I'm currently expanding my skill set by crafting projects and seamlessly integrating them with cloud services like AWS.
